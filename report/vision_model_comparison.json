Furthermore, there is a bear sitting under the trees in the midground, while another bear sits atop a nearby hill. A mushroom is also visible in the scene, likely representing part of the flora. Although no humans are seen, the scene captures the contrasting nature of the forest's lively wildlife and the darkness of the trees near the water.",
